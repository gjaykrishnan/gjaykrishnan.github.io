# Professional Experience

## Deep Learning courses and projects
*PhD*
- Completed foundational Deep Learning course, advanced Geommetric Deep Learning course, as well as specialized course in MLOps.}
- **Project 1: Adversarial attack on Vision Systems**.
  Designed and developed adversarial patches to disrupt the functionality of TartanVO, a learning-based visual odometry model. Leveraged Projected Gradient Descent and Auto-PGD optimizations to craft highly effective patches that significantly deviated camera motion predictions. Conducted experiments with optimization criteria, including translation, rotation, and optical flow errors, and created universal adversarial patches using custom loss functions for targeted disruptions.}
- **Project 2: Self-supervised Graph Representation Learning**.
  Enhanced the preprocessing stage of Simple Graph Convolution by integrating a self-supervised graph representation learning framework. Selected the framework based on extensive experimentation and comparative analysis of generation-based, auxiliary property-based, and contrast-based pretext task methodologies. Evaluated unsupervised models such as Graph Autoencoders, Variational Graph Autoencoders, and Graph Barlow Twins to improve latent feature extraction, enabling superior performance in downstream graph analytics tasks.}
- **Project 3: Deep Learning pipeline with MLOps**.
  Developed a deep learning model pipeline adhering to MLOps best practices for generating piano performance frames. Utilized Google Cloud's Vertex AI for model training and Docker for containerization. Employed Google Compute Engine and Cloud Storage for efficient deployment and data management. Established a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions to automate model building and deployment, ensuring seamless integration and delivery. }
## Research in Combinatorial Optimization
*Advisor: Prof. Asaf Levin, Faculty of Decision and Data Sciences*

*MSc and PhD*
- Developed Approximation schemes (EPTASs and APTASs) for bin packing and scheduling subjected to cardinality constraints and variants of it.
## Research Assistant
*Advisor: Prof. Avi Ostfeld, Faculty of Civil Engineering*

*September 2020 - September 2024*
- Formulated linear and convex programs for water quality analysis, addressing both deterministic and uncertain scenarios. Employed Robust optimization techniques to mitigate uncertainty in program formulations.
## EpyT-C
*Python* 

*November 2023 -- Present*
- Currently engaged in the development of an open-source python package for water quality modeling, slated for publication in a paper for the Journal of Open Source Software.
