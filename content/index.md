## About

I am an about-to-graduate PhD student from the Technion â€” Israel Institute of Technology, specializing in Combinatorial Optimization. My long-term goal is to research and teach Theoretical Computer Science.

My advisor at the Technion is [Prof. Asaf Levin](https://dds.technion.ac.il/academicstaff/asaf-levin/). Together, we developed Approximation schemes for scheduling and bin packing with cardinality constraints and variants of this problem. Refer to my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wVidwjEAAAAJ&hl=en) or [DBLP](https://dblp.org/pid/299/1660) profiles for a complete list of my publications. A less frequently updated list can be found - [[papers]].

During my PhD, I was also a research assistant under [Prof. Avi Ostfeld](https://ostfeld.net.technion.ac.il/). We worked on robust optimization of water quality. [Prof. G R Abhijith](https://www.iitk.ac.in/new/abhijith-g-r) and I released a Python package for water quality simulation called [EPyT-C](https://pypi.org/project/epytc/). I have also worked on deep learning projects and developed an ML pipeline as part of an MLOps project. For more details, please refer to my [CV](./resume.pdf).

I am a novice runner, programmer, photographer, reader, and writer.
